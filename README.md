# Shiny Dashboard Project
This dashboard was created by Matthew Wankiewicz. It takes data from the MLB Savant website using Bill Petti's baseballr package.
Code for the scraping was adapted from this page: https://github.com/robert-frey/YouTube/blob/master/Acquire%20Daily%20Statcast%20Data/Acquire%20statcast%20data%20after%20each%20day.R
Code for the strike zone on the pitching plot was adapted from Jim Albert and Max Marchi's book, Analyzing Baseball Data with R

This code is just a glimpse of what I did, the actual website for this shiny app is https://wnkwz.shinyapps.io/baseball_test/ , just wanted to put the code out to show how I got to the website.
