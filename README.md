# Shiny Dashboard Project
This dashboard was created by Matthew Wankiewicz. It takes data from the MLB Savant website using Bill Petti's baseballr package.
Code for the scraping was adapted from this page: https://github.com/robert-frey/YouTube/blob/master/Acquire%20Daily%20Statcast%20Data/Acquire%20statcast%20data%20after%20each%20day.R
Code for the strike zone on the pitching plot was adapted from Jim Albert and Max Marchi's book, Analyzing Baseball Data with R
